# Alice in Wonderland

## Chapter 1.
### A Dive into the Rabbit Hole

It was becoming bored for Alice to sit without anything to do alongside her sister on a grassy slope; twice she looked in a book, but in it there were no conversations, nor any pictures. "What's the use of a book without pictures and without conversations?" thought Alice.

She felt silly and sleepy - it was quite a hot day. Just then, she argue with herself, whether to stand up, in order to pick daisies and twist the ends off them, when suddenly, out of nowhere, the White Rabbit with pink eyes ran by her.

In that, of course, there was nothing especially remarkable; Alice didn't see and then, when she heard that the Rabbit mutters to himself under his breath: "My God, My God, I am surely late." (Just then, remembering, she concluded that a talking creature was a rarity, but at the time it for some reason seemed to her very natural.)
