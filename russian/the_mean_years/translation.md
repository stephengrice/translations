# The Poor Years

My dear readers! All that is described in this little story is not fiction, no. So developed life by village children of my generation.

Life is not easy – absolute of concerns and anxieties. In twelve years we had to throw away childish entertainment and go to work. Well to say – to work, and how much seat was poured...

I will never forget, how in Spring 1942 I for the first time in my life plowed. My father was on the front lines. My mother every day avoided our homestead’s plot and woefully sighed.

On our plot violently grew sagebrush. The land was withering. It was necessary to plant potatoes, and nobody needed to plow. (?)

In the village remained only women and us – kids.

"Come on, mom, I will dig," I timidly offered my mother.

She looked at my thin, bony figure and suddenly joyfully began laughing, and then at once thought, embraced me and cried.

And on the same day we with my mother plowed. Mother led the horse under the bridge, and I walked to the other side of the plow. The plow in my weak hands dove from side to side, and I, soaked with sweat, dangled behind it. I so jumped up on the plowed place, so (chock-block) I ran along the furrow, that it threw me out to firm, foreign land.

"What are you, like a buffoon, you ride?" mother angrily screamed at me. "Go straighter. Where are you headed? Go in the furrow. Whoaa."

Mother came near me and started to explain something, and I, pleased with the random stop, wiped sweat and, not hearing her voice, greedily caught my breath.

However, the breaks were short. The horse gave us only until noon. Mother again took up the bridge, eye flooded with salty sweat, I often stumbled, fell and furtively cried. But here the lot was plowed. Mother looked around it and with bitterness threw:

"Like pigs burrowed."

She turned and left.

And I still for a long time lay on the grass, watched the crooked, bumpy furrows and thought, Nothing, maybe, is growing here... But as impersonal was wonderment, how much in me was joy and pride when on the lot, in spite of everything, my first harvest together turned green.

With that started my labor school.

Many years passed. Like every other person, in life I had to endure a lot of everything – both of good, and of bad.

And here, finally, after a long separation I again have returned to native parts.

A little cold autumn rain fell...

I accidentally strayed to the closet. In it I saw a small, dust-covered, old chest. I opened it and got down before it on my haunches. In the chest were kept yellowed battlefront letters of my father.

I started to sort them out and suddenly I stumbled on my own letter. The letter, which I wrote to mother in the first year of my life in the city.

I unfolded it, slowly read it and deeply lost myself in thought. In front of me, one after the other swam long past, forgotten days.


### Part 1

## Chapter 1

Our village, Red Hill, in no way differed from the thousand other villages. It stretched along sloping mountainside, and, perhaps because of that, its curved street was pitted with deep ravines. On rainy days around the holes, a thundering direct foot proceeded the little river called Maydanka.

The Maydanka swelled, seethed, washed along a steep, precipitous shore, flooded gardens and caused a lot of hassle for the collective farmers.

As for us, children, the future river was sheer joy. We, barefoot, smeared from head to toe with clay, with whooping and laughter scampered along the shore, accompanied by a hail of rocks swimming about a river of boats. In dry, hot weather, the Maydanka used to dry up completely, and water remained only in the large farm pond. This was located outside of the village.

In it we did run to bathe ourselves. And we stirred up the water until stunned loaches and minnows, which nevertheless were in small amounts, were yet carried away, swam towards shore and stuck out their noses, and those that were weaker suffocated and, hardly alive, floated to the surface belly-up.

We were surprised by that, although we ourselves through bathing in such water cracked our heads, as after a terrible intoxication. But we all the same swam, and we swam until the stableman Egor did not run out of the gate of the horse yard, with width. (?) Now hold on here! Look at the other! Grab your underwear and therefore let your soul go, but not that Egor, though even with gray hair, runs oh so well!

Once, Vitka Utov foolishly got a hold of his own underwear, and along with mine ran away, and I jumped out of the water, without underwear. While I searched, everyone ran away.

I looked around – Egor already behind my back. And I rushed with fear, completely naked, to the ravine, where since ages ago grew only nettles, blackberries and burrs. I plopped down over there, like a kettle full of hot resin. It scratched and burned so much, that the whole week after I was itching. And Vitka laughs above me and says:

"And why have you, bad boy, climbed into this ravine?"

"Why, why – So that the stableman could lash me through and through. And so why did you drag off my underwear?"

"Well, I was yelling to you."

"You were yelling..."

"Yes. And Egor didn’t beat you at all, you made that up. He stood on the bridge and swore."

Whether Egor lashed me or not, I didn’t exactly remember, but arguing with Vitka didn’t stop, and he maintained, although I well knew, that Egor was not evil and would never beat me.

Egor lived beside us. He was not only the stableman, but also a self-taught veterinarian, and he not infrequently came to us falling back on his help. Drilling into a cows foot, mother groans and yells to me:

"Volodka, run and call Egor!"

Poorly eats the pig, I again run to Egor. A sheep fell ill – again to Egor.

And sometimes Egor came to us just like that – to talk with father or to read a newspaper. He was, like an oak, heavy, and when he passed through the door, how low he bent. In the room he obligatorily brought in with him the smell of carbolic soap and tobacco. His family was big: six children, all of them girls.

My father teased Egor for that, and Egor laughed and said:

"Nothing, mine are good to me – everything dispersed." And he turned toward me, winked, and asked: "Right, Volodka? You’ll come, maybe, to marry off to Lyuska?"

I became embarrassed, grabbed my hat and let myself outside. I didn’t like when Egor reminded me of Lyuska. She is quite a good friend to me. Even my best friend Vitka so stealthily used to write on fences with chalk: Lucie+Vova=groom and bride. And which I was the groom! Lyuska was older than me by two years. Her face was round, white, and with small eyebrows – barely noticeably. Her hair also was white, and she braided it in two small pigtails, at the ends of which there was always fancy cloth fluttering.
