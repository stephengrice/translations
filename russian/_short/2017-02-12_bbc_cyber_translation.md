# Head of Britain's center for cybersecurity: Russia is becoming more agressive

### 12 February 2017

**British special services noted an increase in the number of cyberattacks on governmental institutions with the goal of stealing the country's important information, firstly to the areas of defense and foreign policy, said Ciaran Martin, head of the United Kingdom's National Cyber Security Centre, in the internet newspaper Sunday Times. According to him, hackers sponsored by the Russian authorities are behind a large portion of these attacks, though China also represents a considerable number of threats.**

Recently, around 60 major cyberattacks have been directed toward Britain each month, said Martin. In fact, there were a total of 188 attacks on British facilities in the last three months, which the head of the National Cyber Security Center considers to the second and third categories. (?) "Many of them present a threat to national security," he notes.

## New Targets

In the internet newspaper Sunday Times Ciaran Martin said that Moscow changed a rule of the selection of aims - Today, with the target of cyberattacks from Russia, it is becoming websites of local self-governing agencies, where British citizens fill out tax forms and play bills. The goal of these attacks is to obtain personal data, he specified.

Aside from that, the National Cyber Security Centre traced a growth of attacks on websites of charitable organizations - the personal data and financial records of donors can be extracted from these sites - and also on universities, in order to find out what kind of research they are pursuing.

Martin calls all of these target categories "easy." Sometimes hackers choose even harder facilities to attack, up to government establishments.

"In the case of government institutions, the task is to penetrate the system to obtain access to information about the politics of the United Kingdom in various areas - energetics, foreign affairs, or informations about some specific sector. If they attack a company, then they can steal intellectual property," he continues.

## "Worthy Opponents"

In the Sunday Times, Ciaran Martin expressed confidence in that at least a part of these cyberattacks were coordinated from the Kremlin, which accordingly hopes to "strengthen our influence in the West."

"In the past two years, the agression of Russia in the cyberspace has qualitatively changed," he says. "In the midst of these changes we have seen a series of attacks on political bodies of power, parties, Parliamentary organizations - all of these widely known, including our foreign partners."

Lately, representatives of many western special services and administrations expressed concern due to cyberattacks which, as they believe, the Kremlin is launching with the goal of affecting political situations in other countries.

After the scandal with the theft of computers belonging to Hillary Clinton's election staff and the national council of the U.S. democratic party, several German politicians stated that they are afraid of hacking attempts - including Russian ones - that could disrupt the German general elections in the fall of 2017.

Last year, websites belonging to the German councilor Angela Merkel and the Bundestag were attacked by hackers. Responsibility for that attack was claimed by a group of hackers whom call themselves "CyberBerkut."

According to Martin, the Chinese intelligence service also organized several similar attacks.

Russian authorities consistently deny accusations of involvement in any cyber attacks.

"We have worthy rivals, but we manage well in deflecting attacks like this. However, everything is occuring at a very a complex level, which compels us to always be on the alert, and I personally think that a Category 1 incident could occur soon," Ciaran Martin summarizes.

## "Category 1 Incident"

A Cateogry 1 Incident, explains Martin, is of a scale comparable to the theft of servers belonging to the United States Human Resources Office in 2015.

When it occurred, the records of around 21.5 million people, including personnel and people who passed background checks, were leaked as a result of the hack.

"Many of our allies, in countries similar to our own, have been victims of cyberattacks that I would call Category 1 Incidents, and so somewhere there is a clear goal to carry out these attacks," says Martin.

"We cannot eliminate the threat, but defeatism drives me crazy. We shouldn't be defeatists: we can do much more in order to defend ourselves," the head of the UK's National Cybersecurity Center said in an interview with the Sunday Times.
