# Head of Britain's center for cybersecurity: Russia is becoming more agressive

### 12 February 2017

**British special services noted an increase in the number of cyberattacks on governmental institutions with the goal of stealing the country's important information, firstly to the areas of defense and foreign policy, said Ciaran Martin, head of the United Kingdom's National Cyber Security Centre, in the internet newspaper Sunday Times. According to him, hackers sponsored by the Russian authorities are behind a large portion of these attacks, though China also represents a considerable number of threats.**

Recently, around 60 major cyberattacks have been directed toward Britain each month, said Martin. In fact, there were a total of 188 attacks on British facilities in the last three months, which the head of the National Cyber Security Center considers to the second and third categories. (?) "Many of them present a threat to national security," he notes.

## New Targets

In the internet newspaper Sunday Times Ciaran Martin said that Moscow changed a rule of the selection of aims - Today, with the target of cyberattacks from Russia, it is becoming websites of local self-governing agencies, where British citizens fill out tax forms and play bills. The goal of these attacks is to obtain personal data, he specified.

Aside from that, the National Cyber Security Centre traced a growth of attacks on websites of charitable organizations - the personal data and financial records of donors can be extracted from these sites - and also on universities, in order to find out what kind of research they are pursuing.

Martin calls all of these target categories "easy." Sometimes hackers choose even harder facilities to attack, up to government establishments.

"In the case of government institutions, the task is to penetrate the system to obtain access to information about the politics of the United Kingdom in various areas - energetics, foreign affairs, or informations about some specific sector. If they attack a company, then they can steal intellectual property," he continues.
