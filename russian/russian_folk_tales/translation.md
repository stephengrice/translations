## Princess Frog
In some kingdom, in some nation, there lived a king. And he had three sons – all young, unmarried, merry men, such men of whom neither a story can tell nor a pen write. The youngest was named Prince Ivan.

The czar once said these words:

“My dear children! Take up your arrows, pull your bows tight and let the arrows go in different directions. In the yard that the arrows land will be the woman you woo.”

The older brother let his arrow go – it fell in the courtyard of Hawthorn, right against the girl’s tower. The middle brother let his arrow go – it flew toward the merchant, into the courtyard, and stopped near a beautiful porch, and on that porch stood a soul maiden, the merchant’s daughter. The younger brother let his arrow go – it hit a dirty swamp, and it was caught by a frog.

Prince Ivan said:

“How did I take for myself a frog? A frog – it’s not fair to me!”

“Take it,” the czar told him. “To know, it is your destiny.”

Here were the married princes: the older – to Hawthorn, the middle – to a merchant’s daughter, and Prince Ivan – to the frog.

The czar summons them and orders them:

“I want your wives to weave me a carpet in one night.”

Prince Ivan was not amused, beneath his shoulders his head hung violently.

“Ribbit ribbit, Prince Ivan! Why have you crumpled so? Or have I heard from father his cold words?”

“How don’t you grieve for me? My sovereign father ordered in a single night to weave him a silk carpet.”

“Do not grieve, Prince! Lie down  and sleep soundly: Morning evening more mysterious.”

The frog put him to sleep, and she herself threw her frog skin and turned into a girl-beauty, Vasilisa the Wise.  She released to the red porch and cried in a loud voice:

“Nurse-Nanny! Gather, equip yourself silk carpet to weave, where I sat by the hometown of my ancestors.”
