This repository is for openly documenting *some* of the practice I do with non-English langauges. It includes translations, notes, and other easily recorded materials.
Also note that while I may make notes regarding the languages, my goal here is to practice rather than to study. For this reason, I cannot guarantee perfection in any of the work produced here.

Translations
============
In my translations, I employ Luca Lampariello's back-and-forth translation style, in which the source text is translated into your native tongue (English for me), and then (as a crucial step) translated back into the target language. More information about the method can be found on [his website](https://www.thepolyglotdream.com/).
I find it important to include this detail, because when translating back into the original language, the output can be very similar or even exactly the same as the source text, especially if I peek at the original to revisit small details about the text. This being said, if you are the author of something I translate and have a problem, please contact me and I will be glad to help you. (see *Intellectual Property and other concerns* below).

Intellectual Property and other concerns
========================================
If you have a concern with something posted on this repository, such as an issue regarding possible copyright infringement, please do not hesitate to contact me. I will be glad to discuss the matter with you, and if necessary, take down the offending materials from this repository. My purpose in the creation of these files is to improve my foreign-language fluency and to keep track of my progress, NOT to inconvenience or wrong others in any way.
