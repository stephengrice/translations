# Description

This repository is for openly documenting some of the practice I do with non-English langauges. It includes translations, notes, and other easily recorded materials.
Also note that while I may make notes regarding the languages, my goal here is to practice rather than to study. For this reason, I cannot guarantee perfection in any of the work produced here.

#Translations

The translations in this repository are grouped by the source language. At the time of writing, all translations are from another language **to** English. Large compositions, such as entire books, are given their own folder, whereas shorter pieces such as articles can be found in the `_short` directory of each language.

For most translations in this repository, I provide an original and translation file in the Markdown format. Each line in the original file should correspond exactly to the same line number in the translation file. While this is not necessarily immediately obvious when comparing the rendered Markdown text, viewing the original and translation in a split-screen text editor will allow for careful inspection of the differences from original to translation.

# Intellectual Property and other concerns

If you have a concern with something posted on this repository, such as an issue regarding possible copyright infringement, please do not hesitate to contact me. I will be glad to discuss the matter with you, and if necessary, take down the offending materials from this repository. My purpose in the creation of these files is to improve my foreign-language fluency and to keep track of my progress, NOT to inconvenience or wrong others in any way.

Please note that unless otherwise noted, the original materials included in this repository, including articles, books, and so forth, were not written by me and are simply provided for reference. Having the original version handy as well as my translation is helpful for me and for anyone who may be trying to figure out what I meant by a strange phrase or obscure word.
