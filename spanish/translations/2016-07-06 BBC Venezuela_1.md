The other face of the crisis: How the high class live in Venezuela
==================================================================

Juan Paullier

BBC Mundo, Caracas

**It's Friday in Caracas. His son is saying goodbye as the father crosses himself: "What am I going to do?" he asks. "Lock them up?"**

Struck by insecurity, the Venezuelan night has lost its vigor, but is still Venezuela, where the Carribbean spirit and the heartfelt parties `(a flor de piel? - used to show that feelings are evident)` survive.

This businessman of 50 years is speaking with BBC Mundo from his house in El Hatillo, a well-off residential area in the capital.

He has allowed us converse with him, but for safety reasons would prefer his name not to be published.

His daughter also left this Friday. She will send him a messsage when she is with her friends.

More than the shortage of food or medication, the loss of safety in Caracas - which has one of the highest murder rates in the world - is perhaps where the most affluent are feeling the deterioration of the situation in the country.

One lives in constant fear that something will happen, but this doesn't mean that they will stop living.

Determined to continue enjoying himself, this businessman still frequents his favorite restaurants, and tonight he is going to some of the most exclusive parts of the country: the Langunita Country Club, a place where the membership can be as high as US$100,000. Even though he is not a member, his friends still invite him.

Only a short time ago, he was earning up to US$30,000 per month, but now he makes less than a thousand after his company's production fell by 90% in recent times.

He says it is the result of the obstacles imposed by the government and of his preference to do things right despite seeing himself badly affected. He maintains hs lifestyle thanks to the other businesses on the outside.

"You know why this hasn't stopped blowing up?" one of his friends asks me, whiskey in his hand, by the dance floor.

"Because even those at the bottom have hope... Hope of getting themselves some food. The day no hope remains, this will stop collapsing," he adds.

This friend, who worked for years on the stock exchange and who now enjoys art collecting, admits that he could live in his house in Miami, but says that, in spite of all else, he wants to live in Venezuela.

He is just one of several people of distinct strata who believe that the worse the situation gets, the better: that "everything has to stop exploding so that the long road to reconstruction can begin."

Without Barriers
----------------
`(sin colas - en esas colas; refer to lower class of people?)`

The businessman is one of them. He lives comfortably, yet remains aware of the reality of the country. He says that the situation is untenable.

Although he does not suffer the four and a half hours every day that the average Venezuelan spends to buy some of the products regulated by the government, the crisis is not far from him.

Like the rest of the people at his level, he acquires food by other means.

He usually gets his food through the employees of his business, but he decided to stop buying from them when they wanted to charge 40,000 bolívares (about US$40 on the black market) for 20 kilograms of PAN Flour (pre-cooked corn flour, basic ingrediente of *arepas*).

The regulated price is 19 bolívares.

He considers himself to be upper middle class and not a rich man. "I feel like a pauper next to my friends," he jokes.

His 19-year-old son says that only a short time ago, an acquaintance of his way kidnapped, and when his circle found out, a friend arrived with US$70,000 cash to pay for the rescue.

Others have jets for trips out of the country and small planes to celebrate a birthday with a day in the Los Roques archipelago.

There is a Venezuela that still lives this way.

A Venezuela where the fashionable restaurants are still filling up, where in the stores with imported products, there is a line to pay. Where, midday on a Tuesday, a woman buys some luxurious Swarovski earrings in a mall.

A Venezuela where the birthdays are celebrated with 18-year-old whisky, where the musicians J Balvin and Farruko are booked for a 15-year-old girl's birthday party `(quinceaños)` and where a woman celebrates with friends with a private concert by Luis Miguel.

A Special Class
---------------

They can be big businessmen, directors of companies, successful professionals and "boliburgueses," people close to Chavism that made their riches with the help of the government.

One who has access to dollars in Venezuela still lives comfortably, unlike many who can barely survive.

It is estimated that this powerful class could represent 16% of the population, a little less than 5 million people.

They are divided into an A/B segment, which happened to be 3.1% in 1999 and 1.3% this year, and a C group, that was 18.2% when Huga Chavez rose to power and is now 14.8%.

It is a group of the population that, historically, has been accustomed to an elevated standard of life in an oil-producing nation.

"Since the 80s, no one saves in bolívares, Venezuela has been undervalued, we were earning tons of of dollars and now you have relevant savings in foreign currencies, much more than any other upper middle class in Latin America," explains Luis Vicente León, economist and director of the polling company Datanálisis.

Even though they maintain his standard of living, he points out that "they are losing the ability to buy and making their life significantly more expensive. Savings and income are being reduced, their cash flow stopped and they are living off what they made, not what they are making."

The Known History
-----------------

The other face of the country, the most well-known, is the face of those who need to go to five different stores or supermarkets to finish their shopping.

The face of the people who wait in line after line. In these lines wait the people who cannot - or do not want - to resort to the black market and to the "bachaqueros" that acquire products at regulated prices and resell them at a much higher price in the parallel market.

Amid the shortage of food that is sweeping Venezuela, there is still food. The majority of 40 basic products whose prices have been regulated by the government for 13 years are the hardest to find.

The rest can be obtained.

Entering a supermarket is not a problem, unless you need to buy one of the products within.
