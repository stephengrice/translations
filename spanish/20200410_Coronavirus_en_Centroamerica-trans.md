# Coronavirus in Central America: the region of records and contrasts in strategies and results against COVID-19

By Marcos González Díaz

**In a land that occupies as little space as Central America, one can identify each of the most disparate strategies being employed to combat COVID-19.**

As if they were a reflection of that which happens in the rest of the world, amidst the seven countries of this region are examples of governments that opted for more drastic methods to avoid the entry of coronavirus and of others that resist putting these methods into effect.

**There is also significant contrast in their results:** Central America is home to the country with the highest count of infections in Latin American and which, paradoxically, shares a border with another nation flaunting the lowest mortality rate for COVID-19.

As of this Thursday, Central America officially reported **103 deaths and nearly 4,000 people infected** by the new coronavirus.

This is a review, country by country, of the remarkably diverse situations that Central America is facing in this coronavirus pandemic.

## Panama: The largest number of cases

Its strategic position as an international hub of air and maritime traffic through which millions pass each years made it foreseeable that the coronavirus would arrive in Panama earlier and in greater volume than its neighbors in the region.

Its official figures continued to increase and, with 2,752 cases and 66 deaths as of this Thursday, Panama is the Latin American country **with the highest number of infections for every 100,000 inhabitants.**

It also held the highest regional number of deaths until Wednesday, the date when it was surpassed by less than a tenth by Ecuador, where dramatic images were seen that had nothing to do with the situation in Panama.

The lethality of the Central American country (2.6%) is, in fact, less than half of that of Ecuador.

One of the main reasons behind the high numbers in Panama is that it is the second country in the region - after Chile - that **performs the highest number of tests for COVID-19 per capita within its population**, which is typically correlated with an increased number of confirmed cases.

Doctor Jorge Victoria, from the OPS/OMS of Panama, told the newspaper La Prensa that while Italy, Spain, and the United States waited up to 20 days after the first case to implement testing on a massive scale, the Central American country has been doing it since the first positive case.

Panama also has the advantage of being medically prepared: according to the World Bank, it is the fourth Latin American country - after Cuba, Argentina, and Uruguay - in having the largest number of hospital beds for every 1,000 people.

## El Salvador: the first to close its borders

The smallest country in the region stood out by taking drastic measures from the very start in slowing the arrival of the coronavirus.

In fact, on March 11, it became the first Latin American country **to prohibit the entry of foreign persons to its territory.**
