# Coronavirus in Central America: the region of records and contrasts in strategies and results against COVID-19

By Marcos González Díaz

**In a land that occupies as little space as Central America, one can identify each of the most disparate strategies being employed to combat COVID-19.**

As if they were a reflection of that which happens in the rest of the world, amidst the seven countries of this region are examples of governments that opted for more drastic methods to avoid the entry of coronavirus and of others that resist putting these methods into effect.

**There is also significant contrast in their results:** Central America is home to the country with the highest count of infections in Latin American and which, paradoxically, shares a border with another nation flaunting the lowest mortality rate for COVID-19.

As of this Thursday, Central America officially reported **103 deaths and nearly 4,000 people infected** by the new coronavirus.

This is a review, country by country, of the remarkably diverse situations that Central America is facing in this coronavirus pandemic.
