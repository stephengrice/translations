## Columbus, the Natives, and the Progress of Humanity

The arawak men and women, naked, brown, and prisoners of perplexity, emerged from their villages toward the beaches of the island and entered the water to better see the strange boat. When Columbus and his sailors went ashore carrying swords and speaking in a strange tongue, the arawak natives ran to welcome them, to bring them food, water, and gifts. Columbus later wrote in his diary:

```
They brought us parrots and cotton balls and spears and many other things that changed by count and Hawk's bells (?). They had no objection to giving us everything they had... They were of good constitution, with well-formed bodies and beautiful features... They don't carry weapons, nor do they know of them. When we showed them a sword, they took it by the blade and cut themselves because they didn't know what it was. They do not have iron. Their spears are made of reeds... They would make magnificent servants... With fifty men we could overpower all of them and do as we wish with them.
```

These arawaks from the Antillean Islands look much like the natives from the mainland, in that they were extraordinary (as observing Europeans would repeatedly note) for their hospitality, their delivery at the time of sharing. These characteristics were not exactly at their peak in Renaissance Europe, dominated as they were by the religion of the Popes, the government of the kings, and the obsession for money that characterized Western civilization and its first emissary to the Americas, Christopher Columbus.

Columbus wrote:

```
Just arriving to the Antilles, in the first Antilles, on the first island that I found, I caught some natives so they could learn and give me information about what there was around those places.
```

The question [issue] that most spurred Columbus was: Where is the gold? The kings of Spain had been convinced to finance his expedition to those lands. He was hoping that on the other side of the Atlantic - in "India" and in Asia - there were riches, gold and spices. Like his other enlightened contemporaries, he knew that the world was spherical and that he could navigate to the west to arrive at the Far East.

Spain had just unified, forming one of the new modern nation-states, like France, England, and Portugal. Its population, largely composed of farmers, worked for the nobility, which represented 2% of the population, these being the owners of 95% of the land. Spain had been involved with the Catholic Church, had expelled all the Jews and chased away the Muslims. Like other states in the modern world, Spain was in search of gold, a substance that was becoming the new measure of wealth, with more usefulness than land because everyone could buy it.

There was gold in Asia, or so it was thought, and certainly silk and spices, because a few centuries ago, Marco Polo and others had brought marvellous things from their expeditions by land. Upon conquering the turkish Constantinople and the western Mediterranean, and upon having the land routes to Asia in his power, a sea route was needed. Every day, the Portuguese sailors went further in their exploration of the southern tip of Africa. Spain decided to play the card of a long expedition through an unknown ocean.

In exchange for sharing gold and spices, Columbus was promised 10% of the profits, the position of governor of discovered lands, in addition to the fame that his new title would carry: Sea Ocean Admiral. He was a merchant from the Italian city of Genova, eventual weaver (son of  a very skilled weaver) and expert navigator. He set out with the caravels, the larges of which was the __Santa Maria__, a sailboat of around thirty meters in length, with a crew of thirty-nine people.

Columbus never would have arrived in Asia, which was thousands of kilometers farther than he had calculated, imagining a smaller world. Such an extension of the sea would have been his demise. But he was lucky. When he reached a quarter of the distance, he found himself with an unknown land that did not appear on any map and was between Europe and Asia: the Americas. This occurred in early October of 1492, thirty-three days after he and his crew had set sail from the Canary Islands, on the Atlantic coast of Africa. They suddenly saw logs floating in the water, birds flying. Signs of land. Then, on October 12, a sailor named Rodrigo saw the morning moon shining on some white sand and gave the alarm signal. They were the Antilles, in the Carribbean. It was presumed that the first man to see land had to get a lifetime pension of 10,000 maravedis [old Spanish money], but Rodrigo never received it. Columbus said that he had seen a moon the night before and it was he that received the reward.

When they approached the land, the Arawak Indians welcomed them by swimming to the boats to receive them. The Arawak lived in small communal towns, and their farming was based on corn, yams, and Yucca. They knew how to weave and spin, but they had no horses or farm animals. They had no iron, but they wore tiny golden ornaments in their ears.

This act would carry dramatic consequences: Columbus captured several of them and made them climb aboard, insisting that they take him to the source of the gold. He later navigated to what we now call the island of Cuba, and afterward to Hispaniola (the island that is today composed of Haiti and the Dominican Republic). There, the sparkle of gold was visible in the rivers, and the golden mask that a native chief offered Columbus provoked delirious visiones of endless gold.

On Hispaniola, Columbus built a fort with wood from the __Santa Maria__, which he had run aground. It was the first European military base in the Western hemisphere. He called it __Navidad__, and there he left thirty-nine members of his crew with instructions to find and store gold. He captured more natives and sent them on the two ships they still had. On a part of the island he got mixed up in a fight with several natives that refused to provide the amount of bows and arrows that the men wanted. Two were stabbed with swords and bled to death. Then the __Ni√±a__ and the __Pinta__ boarded for the Azores and Spain. When the weather cooled, some of the native prisoners died.

Columbus's report to the Court of Madrid was extravagant. It insisted on the fact that they had arrived in Asia (referring to Cuba) and an island of coastal China (Hispaniola). His descriptions were part fact, part fiction:

```
Hispaniola is a miracle. Mountains and hills, plains and pastures, they are as fertile as they are beautiful... The natural harbors are incredibly good and there are many wide rivers, the majority of which contain gold... There are many spices, and nine large mines for gold and other metals...
```

The natives, according to Columbus's report: "They are so naive and generous with their possessions that no one who hasn't see them would believe it. When you ask for soemthing that they have, they never
