## Columbus, the Natives, and the Progress of Humanity

The arawak men and women, naked, brown, and prisoners of perplexity, emerged from their villages toward the beaches of the island and entered the water to better see the strange boat. When Columbus and his sailors went ashore carrying swords and speaking in a strange tongue, the arawak natives ran to welcome them, to bring them food, water, and gifts. Columbus later wrote in his diary:

```
They brought us parrots and cotton balls and spears and many other things that changed by count and Hawk's bells (?). They had no objection to giving us everything they had... They were of good constitution, with well-formed bodies and beautiful features... They don't carry weapons, nor do they know of them. When we showed them a sword, they took it by the blade and cut themselves because they didn't know what it was. They do not have iron. Their spears are made of reeds... They would make magnificent servants... With fifty men we could overpower all of them and do as we wish with them.
```

These arawaks from the Antillean Islands look much like the natives from the mainland, in that they were extraordinary (as observing Europeans would repeatedly note) for their hospitality, their delivery at the time of sharing. These characteristics were not exactly at their peak in Renaissance Europe, dominated as they were by the religion of the Popes, the government of the kings, and the obsession for money that characterized Western civilization and its first emissary to the Americas, Christopher Columbus.

Columbus wrote:

```
Just arriving to the Antilles, in the first Antilles, on the first island that I found, I caught some natives so they could learn and give me information about what there was around those places.
```

The question [issue] that most spurred Columbus was: Where is the gold? The kings of Spain had been convinced to finance his expedition to those lands. He was hoping that on the other side of the Atlantic - in "India" and in Asia - there were riches, gold and spices. Like his other enlightened contemporaries, he knew that the world was spherical and that he could navigate to the west to arrive at the Far East.

Spain had just unified, forming one of the new modern nation-states, like France, England, and Portugal. Its population, largely composed of farmers, worked for the nobility, which represented 2% of the population, these being the owners of 95% of the land. Spain had been involved with the Catholic Church, had expelled all the Jews and chased away the Muslims. Like other states in the modern world, Spain was in search of gold, a substance that was becoming the new measure of wealth, with more usefulness than land because everyone could buy it.

There was gold in Asia, or so it was thought, and certainly silk and spices, because a few centuries ago, Marco Polo and others had brought marvellous things from their expeditions by land.
